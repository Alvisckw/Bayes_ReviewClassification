This is the GitHub repository for my contribution to the Text Classification project.

It is the **Final Course Project** of SMM694 Applied NLP module for 2022/23 MSc Business Analytics at Bayes Business School.

## Project Aim
- To classify beer reviews (texts) into 3 rating levels:
    - 0/okay: [3.5 - 4)
    - 1/good: [4 - 4.5)
    - 2/excellent: [4.5 - 5]

## Code Explanation
- Pre-processed the text data with NLP pipeline
- Trained and tested multiple classification models with [train.csv](./data/train.csv)
- (Classified reviews in [true_labels.csv](./data/true_labels.csv))
